## Git and GitHub

Git,GitHub were new tools for me, so inspire me for new accomplishments.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I learned a lot of  new information from this courses already, I even installed Linux on my home PC and started to use it.

## Git Collaboration

It was a secondary course about Git and Github for,now i am more confident in using this tools.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

[Task done](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/kottans-frontend/tree/master/task_responsive_web_design)

Grid,flex were new techniques for me, so i learned a lof.Especially i liked Froggy style of game, thats was so visually and easy to understand.

## JS Basics

[Task done](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/kottans-frontend/tree/master/task_js_basics)

I guess it was the most difficult task here and in the same time most interesting and educational.I spent a lot more time than it should be but i think it is how it works.

## DOM

A lot of new stuff,DOM methods were interesting.

That was a little training for understanding purpose of OOP.

## JS OOP
[Task done](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/kottans-frontend)
 
[Practice](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

It was most complex task because you need to work with already implemented engine.

## Memory pair game

[Demo](https://arthurgorbenko.github.io/Memory-pair-game-Pokemon-s-edition/)

[Code base](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/Memory-pair-game-Pokemon-s-edition)


It is my first more or less compicated project with some logic on JS.Learned a lof about readability of code and different techniques such as flipping items,comparing attributes.I spend a lof of time dealing with bugs like user's opportunity to open more than 2 cards and flipping them back.

## Friend's app

[Demo](https://arthurgorbenko.github.io/Friend-s-app/)

[Code base](https://github.com/ArthurGorbenko/Friend-s-app)

This project I rewrite twice because first I implemented wrong logic, where all sorting and filtering processes were attach to DOM elements instead data. I got some experience with adaptation my app on mobile phones.
